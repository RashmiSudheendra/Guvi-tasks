1. Differences between HTTP1.1 Vs HTTP2

            HTTP1.1 - The standarized protocol.
            HTTP2 - A protocol for greater performance.

            HTTP1.1 - If one resource is not loaded, all other resources are blocked. As it loads resource
                            one after other.
            HTTP2 -   No resources are blocked, if one resoucre is not loaded. As it loads resources 
                            using multiple streams(Multiplexing).

        	  HTTP1.1 - It transfers all the requests and response in plain text messages form.
	  HTTP2 -    It works on binary framing layer, it converts all the message to binary format.

	  HTTP1.1 - It compresses data by itself.
	  HTTP2 -    It uses HPACK for data compression.

            HTTP2 is faster than HTTP1.1, But we use HTTP1.1 majorly as it is standarized protocol.

2. Objects and Its internal representation.

            Objects is a reference data type in Javascript which may be the combination of any primitive 
                data-types. Objects are refered as buidling blocks of modern javascript. Object has properties
                associated with it.

            Representation: Objects are unordered collections of related data, in form of "key:Value" pairs.
                                     These keys can be functions or variables and values are properties and methods,
                                     respectively according to the context.

            Syntax : objectName.propertyName
	      e.g., : var Student = new Object();
                              Student.name = 'Rashmi';


	  In the above example Student is object and name is property and 'Rashmi' is value of property
                name. And student name is key and 'Rashmi' is value.
